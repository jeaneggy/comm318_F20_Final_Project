"Note: Details may not sum to totals due to rounding. Violent-crime categories include rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault, and they include threatened, attempted, and completed occurrences of those crimes. Year-to-year statistically significant differences may vary from those previously reported. Previously, BJS created standard errors and presented testing for statistically significant differences among National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) estimates in this table using generalized variance function parameters, while this table uses the Balanced Repeated Replication method. See Methodology for more information on the differences between these methods of variance estimation. See appendix table 5 for standard errors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
