## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project


My Final Project is on **sexual assault and the underreporting of cases in the US.** The questions I strove to answer include: How have the cases of sexual abuse in the U.S. changed over the past few years? Who is most at risk of being a victim of sexual abuse? How do the sexual assault cases look at a local level, like in New York City? Is there a difference between the number of sexual assault cases and the number of sexual assault reports? Why do so many victims choose not to report?

I have chosen to create a data blog with the target audience of the general public. I decided on this format to allow for an easy-to-read article with clear visualizations to communicate my story. My presentation starts with information and trends about national sexual assault data, along with information on common demographics of sexual assault victims. Then, I discuss the problem of the underreporting of sexual assault cases and go into detail about the reasons behind this phenomenon. Following that, I discuss the Me Too Movement's impact and how many survivors are opting to disclose their trauma publicly or online instead of reporting to the police. I end by reiterating the conclusions of my project and communicating how I believe we should move forward to decrease the number of sexual assault victims and protect those most at risk.
